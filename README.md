Parkinson disease patients suffer from "Freezing of Gait"(FOG) events during daily normal activities. Medical research has shown Rhythmic auditory cueing can recover normal gait when freezing events occur. The occurence of FOG events need to be detected using sensors and this can be achieved using body worn accelerometer based systems. Thess system can be made more cheaper and scalable with implementation of low sized ML models. Microsoft India 's EgdeML models - ProtoNN and Bonsai are implemented in order to achieve system model sizes as low as possible while that of Standard ML models are at hundreds of KBs
